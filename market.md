QJSON Agents — Market Brief

Positioning
- Local‑first, inspectable agent runtime with durable memory and optional web crawling, designed for developers and teams that value privacy, control, and testability.
- Differentiates from closed SaaS agents by offering full transparency, reproducibility, and zero heavy dependencies.

Target Segments
- Individual developers and small teams prototyping agentic workflows on local machines.
- Security‑sensitive orgs (finance, healthcare, legal) requiring on‑prem data handling.
- Research labs evaluating agent memory/orchestration variants without vendor lock‑in.
- Enterprises exploring multi‑agent orchestration and retrieval without managed RAG stacks.

Key Use Cases
- Local knowledge assistants with persistent memory and verifiable logs.
- Experimental swarms (ring/mesh/MoE) with router telemetry and fairness analysis.
- Web research: outline, crawl, index, and search external content with strict caps.
- Data product scaffolding: ingest docs, build IVF‑like indexes, hybrid ranking for Q&A.

Value Drivers
- Total control: audit every step; no hidden services or long dependency trees.
- Cost predictability: use local models (Ollama) and deterministic fallbacks.
- Speed to insight: simple CLI/menu; minimal setup; strong defaults.
- Extensibility: plugins, slash commands, and clean module boundaries.

Competitive Landscape
- Cloud assistants (OpenAI/Anthropic/Cohere/Copilot): superior models, limited transparency; QJSON excels in local control and inspectability.
- Open‑source agent frameworks (LangChain/LangGraph/AutoGen): larger ecosystems; QJSON focuses on minimalism, deterministic state, and out‑of‑the‑box CLI UX.
- RAG stacks (LlamaIndex/Weaviate/Pinecone): feature‑rich vector stores; QJSON embeds a pragmatic, dependency‑light IVF‑like index inside the fractal store.

Monetization Options
- Open core: free base, plus paid add‑ons (headless crawl scheduler, connectors, premium rankers).
- Support & services: enterprise onboarding, integration, and performance tuning.
- Distribution: opinionated bundles (GPU builds, curated model packs, examples) for internal developer platforms.

Pricing Hints
- Replacement cost basis: $90k–$220k (8k LOC of non‑trivial Python + docs + tests).
- Asset sale (no traction): $20k–$80k; higher if licenses/compliance/benchmarks are in place.
- Strategic acquisition: $80k–$180k with demos and clean licensing.

Go‑to‑Market
- Launch as a PyPI package with semver releases.
- Produce short demos: “local crawl + index + Q&A in 2 minutes.”
- Author blog posts on: fractal memory design, IVF‑without‑deps, menu‑driven UX, and recoverable swarms.
- GitHub project boards; triage “good first issues.”

Risks & Mitigations
- Licensing ambiguity → add permissive license and third‑party attributions.
- Model variance → keep conservative defaults (caps, timeouts) and acknowledgements.
- Crawl compliance → robots.txt, rate limits, and strict content caps (already in place).
